## Exam

The exam in security will be a 30 minutes oral examination. The grade is based upon an overall assessment including the complexity/depth/width of the project and
the studentâ€™s display of curriculum knowledge at the exam. One grade is given according to the Danish 7-point scale. You must hand in a written project related to the topic. The student will prepare a (app. ten minutes) presentation of the solution of one of the topics they worked with. Further discussions will be based on the presentation, and a drawn question related to the curriculum. If you should fail the exam there will be 2 re-exams but failing both re-exams will result in being expelled.
